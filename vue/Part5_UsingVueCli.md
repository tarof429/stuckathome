# Using Vue CLI

## Introduction

So far, we've been using a single HTML file and a single Javascript file to write our Vue apps. This will not scale and so we need to learn how to use the Vue CLI. Also we need a method for serving our application, not double-clicking on the HTML file as we have been doing. 

## Installation

1. Install npm

    ```
    pacman -S npm`
    ```

2. Install vue

    ```
    sudo npm install -g @vue/cli
    ```

3. To create a project:

    ```
    npm create <project.name>
    ```

4. Afterwards you can run the project.

    ```
    npm run serve
    ```

In VS Code, you should install the `vetur` extension which will help writing code for Vue.
