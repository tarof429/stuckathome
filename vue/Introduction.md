# Vue.js

## What is Vue.js?

Vue.js is a JavaScript framework that makes building interactive and reactive web frontends (browser-side web applications) easier.

## Some notes about these notes

These notes are based on the Udemy course given in the reference section. The course first demonstrates (in section 1.5) what you would have to do to write an interactive web application using pure Javascript. This demo illustrates the importance of working with the DOM, but also highlights how tedious it can be to write web applications without a framework. The course then goes on to explain how to write applications using Vue.
