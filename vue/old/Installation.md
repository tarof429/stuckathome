# Installation

There are several options to install npm.

1. Install npm as a native package

    ```
    sudo pacman -S npm
    ```

2. Install vue using npm

    ```
    sudo npm install -g @vue/cli
    ```

    Remember to use `sudo` to intall npm modules to avoid a permission error.

3. Alternatively you can use yarn (you need to install yarn)

    ```
    sudo yarn global add @vue/cli
    ```
