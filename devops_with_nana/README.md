# DevOps with Nana

## Core Concepts

1. The CI/CD pipeline, which orchestrates all kinds of technologies used to deliver software, is the most important part of DevOps.
2. DevOps is not a role for beginners.
3. There are 4 different stages of learning need to master DevOps. 

## Roadmap

### Level 1: DevOps Pre-Requisites
You need to master Linux, which you'll  find ubiquitously in servers in the cloud. Another key concept is git, which is used to track changes. Another is package management such as Maven, npm and Gradle. 

### Level 2: DevOps Fundamentals
There are a few DevOps fundamentals that you also need to know:

1. Containerization such as Docker that encapsulates all the dependencies needed to run applications.
2. Artifact Registries that stores different kinds of artifacts. A registry will contain mulitple repositories.
3. Cloud technologies where applications and services run. 

### Level 3: DevOps Core
1. Container orchestration such as Kubernetes that abstracts many servers into a single powerful virtual machine.
2. Advanced cloud platform skills such as AWS. Large providers provide services such as Kubernetes. 
3. CI/CD pipelines that automate theintegration of code changes from build, test to delivery on production servers in the cloud.

### Level 4: DevOps Advanced
1. Infrastructure as code, such as Terraform and Pulumi. Pulumi lets you provision cloud infrastructure using a language you're already famiiar with like Python and Go. 
2. A programming language such as Python.
3. A configuration management tool such as Ansible.
4. Monitoring & observability tools such as Prometheus. 
5. Security
