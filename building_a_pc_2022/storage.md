# Storage

Recently, I've been buying components to rebuild my PC which is running ArchLinux. The motherboard is a B550 from AsRock and features two M2 slots: one on the top and one on the bottom. The one on the top uses the faster PCIe 4.0 bus and is described as a Hyper M.2 (PCIe Gen4 x4) while the one on the bottom is an Ultra M.2 (PCIe Gen3x4). I decided to do some research on the differences.

## Hyper M.2 versus Ultra M.2

We all know by now that M.2 is fast, much faster than SATA SSDs and Hard Disks. ASRock doesn't explain what to expect, so I did some research and found that Hyper M.2 is capable of 2GB/s per lane. Since the motherboard has 4 lanes for the M.2 slot, this translates to 8 GB/s. I don't need to transfer data at that speed but it's good to know.


## Cost of M.2 NVMe

Most M.2 NVMe storage in the 1TB range cost between $100 and $150. This is a bargain in my opinion. The differences are mainly in terms of performance, thermals and encryption.
