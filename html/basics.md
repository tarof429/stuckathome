# HTML Basics

## Introduction

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration box.

## Selectors

There are several types of selectors:

- The **element selector** is the most basic and selects elements based on the tag name, such as \<p\>. This is useful for changing the style of the page in one go.

- If you want to use the same HTML tag but style them differently, you can use the **id selector**.

- The **class selector** ignores the tag and lets you style elements by a class name.
