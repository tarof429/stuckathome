# The "Short Guide to building a PC in 2022" Manifesto

Below is a very opinionated guide on building a PC in 2022

- Only build PCs for Mini-ITX
- More cores are better
- Black is better than white
- Only run Archlinux
- Backup often
- Update often
- RTFM
- Don't spend too much
- Reuse old parts
- Make sure you can "hear" your computer
- Do it the hard way, not the easy way
